                            The Core Membership is ideal for individuals who want full access to high-quality equipment and group classes, without the extras. It’s designed for members who are self-motivated, enjoy a structured environment, and want flexibility without long-term contracts.
                            <br>
                            With this membership, you’ll receive unlimited access to the gym during staffed hours, typically from 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, and 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM on weekends. You’ll have full use of our extensive range of equipment including cardio machines, weight racks, free weights, and functional training stations. Additionally, Core Members can participate in our unlimited group fitness classes at no extra cost — choose from yoga, HIIT, bootcamp, spin, and core conditioning sessions, all led by energetic, certified instructors.

                            <br>
                            This tier includes 24/7 access to the entire facility via secure key fob entry, allowing you to train at any hour that suits your schedule — early mornings, late nights, or weekends without restrictions. Forge Members can skip the crowds and take ownership of their routine, especially those with unpredictable schedules or who thrive in quieter hours.

                            You’ll enjoy all of the group fitness benefits included in the Core Membership, plus unlimited use of our recovery lounge, which features infrared saunas, massage chairs, compression boots, and foam rolling stations. These amenities are designed to support your recovery, reduce soreness, and optimize performance between workouts.
